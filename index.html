  <br/>
    <br/>
     
<p>With rapid technological advancements, organizations around the globe continue to experience massive incidents of cyberattacks.
  Typically, these cyberattacks are associated to both <b>insider</b> as well as <b>outsider</b> attacks. 
  In this regard, outsider attacks refers to attacks
  originating from the internet while insider attacks refers to attacks originating from within an organization.</p>
  
  <p>To mitigate cyberthreats, therefore, organizations must be prepared to address both insider as well as outsider threats.While technical 
    security controls can help to in addressing outsider threats, they might fail to properly detect and identify insider attacks. This is 
    because insider attacks are initiated by individuals entrusted and given acccess privileges to access critical business assets within an organization.</p>
    <p>They can include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Employees</li> 
    <li>Security personnel</li> 
    <li>Managers</li>
      <li>Contractors</li>
    <li>Suppliers</li>
    </ul>

  <h3 style="text-align:center" class="text-primary">How Does The Human Element Compromise Corporate Networks</h3>
    
  <p> These individuals pose significant security challenges and risks because they have privilleged access while accessing critical business data
networks, or information systems. Accordingly, they might engage in malicious actions that can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, 
    and availability of critical business assets. </p>
  
  <p> For instance, disgruntled employees may engage in malicious actions and steal valuable business data such as customers' credit card data.
    Besides stealing, they can also damage this data or partner with third-party cybercriminals. They might also leak valuable business data
    to competitors or even the media.</p>
  
  <p>Additionally, employees also pose significant security risks because they can be targeted by cybercriminals through phishing attacks.
    Typically, a phishing attack is a type of social engineering attack whereby the attacker tricks unsuspicious user into revealing valuable
    and confidential information that can be used to perpetrate an attack. For instance, the attacker may target an employee by sending
    an email with malicious web site link or images. if the user clicks on the link, she will be redirected to a malicious site, which might
    appear as legitimate,and which the attacker can use to collect vital data such as login credentials.</p>
  
  <p>Employees can also compromise the corporate network by using compromised USB devices. With the rise of Bring Your Own Device <b>(BYOD)</b> 
    policy, compromised employees mobile devices can be used an attacker to infiltrate the corporate network. Moreover, the use of insecure
    public Wi-Fi can also lead to data breaches.</p>
  
  <p>From the above points, it is clear that the human element must be adddressed if an organization wants to maintain a resilient and robust
    cybersecurity posture. This requires cybersecurity leaders to implement effective technical security controls such as firewalls, or 
    intrusion detection and prevention systems with artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. Technical controls can also include 
    the installation of antivirus and anti-malware applications as well as blocking unused ports.
    Also, it is important to 
    implement security training and awareness programs to equip employees with the latest cybersecurity news and threats.</p>
