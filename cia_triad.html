     <h3>The CIA Triad</h3>
       <br>
       
       <p> <img class="img-responsive" src="cia_triad.png" alt="CIA Triad"> </p> <br/><br/> 
      
      <p>The three letters in "CIA triad" stand for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. The CIA triad is a common model that 
        forms the basis for the development of security systems. They are used for finding vulnerabilities and methods for creating solutions.

The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information is crucial to the operation of a business, and the CIA triad 
segments these three ideas into separate focal points. This differentiation is helpful because it helps guide security teams as they pinpoint 
    the different ways in which they can address each concern. Ideally, when all three standards have been met, the security profile of
        the organization is stronger and better equipped to handle threat incidents.         
        </p>
      
      <p>Confidentiality involves the efforts of an organization to make sure data is kept secret or private. To accomplish this, access to 
        information must be controlled to prevent the unauthorized sharing of data—whether intentional or accidental. A key component of 
        maintaining confidentiality is making sure that people without proper authorization are prevented from accessing assets important 
        to your business. Conversely, an effective system also ensures that those who need to have access have the necessary privileges.</p>
      
      <p>Integrity involves making sure your data is trustworthy and free from tampering. The integrity of your data is maintained only 
        if the data is authentic, accurate, and reliable. Compromising integrity is often done intentionally. An attacker may bypass an 
        intrusion detection system (IDS), change file configurations to allow unauthorized access, or alter the logs kept by the system to
        hide the attack. Integrity may also be violated by accident. Someone may accidentally enter the wrong code or make another kind of 
        careless mistake. Also, if the company’s security policies, protections, and procedures are inadequate, integrity can be violated 
        without any one person in the organization accountable for the blame.     
        </p>
      
      <p>Even if data is kept confidential and its integrity maintained, it is often useless unless it is available to those in the 
        organization and the customers they serve. This means that systems, networks, and applications must be functioning as they should and 
        when they should. Also, individuals with access to specific information must be able to consume it when they need to, and getting to 
        the data should not take an inordinate amount of time.</p>
